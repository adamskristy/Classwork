## Giphy
Use Giphy to pull some giphs

Let's build a react giphy app!

Your task is:
- Go to the Giphy docs [HERE](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk), read them, create an account and get your Free API key.
- Diagram your App:
    - What components will you have?
    - Where would state "live"?
    - Where do you need to pass props?

ðŸš€ Completion looks like:
- Minimum of 3 components.
- A diagram of your component hierarchy.
- No gifs will be fetched on intial page load
- An application that renders a button on page load.
- On Button click make an API call and retrieve/render a single random GIF
