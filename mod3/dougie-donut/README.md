# Dougie the Donut & Pizza Rat
Dougie the Donut and Pizza Rat are now best buds taking New York City by storm. Now instead of causing trouble against each other, they've taken it upon themselves to cause trouble around the city! The catch is, they don't want to get caught by the police (in other words, they want to eat their cake and have it, too) so they've put their brains together to come up with a helpful app idea that will allow them to see what kind of trouble they can cause without getting thrown in jail. Let's help them build it!

 
Getting Started:

You will be provided with the JavaScript necessary for fetching data from the API. The rest is up to you!

Take a look at the array of objects that the API sends back to you... particularly the borough, descriptor, and resolution_description properties. Keep in mind that sometimes that last one is not included.

 ### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Below is a more detailed list of what functionalities Dougie and Pizza Rat want for their app.

1. Users should be able to see five buttons for the five boroughs (manhattan, brooklyn, queens, staten island, bronx) of New York City when they load the page
2. Users should also be able to see an input box where they can put in a number of how many complaints they want to see
3. If the user doesn't input any number, make the default be 10
4. When the list of complaints is shown, each complaint should also have a button on it that reads something along the lines of "toggle police response"
5. When the user clicks on on the "toggle police response" button, it should then toggle how the police responded to that particular complaint
6. Make sure it only toggles the response for that one complaint, not the entire list!
