//nested for loop
//O(n^2), worst one

//BIG O NOTATION
// Big O is used to approximate how long an algorithim takes to run

//Ex. does loop depend on value entered "n"? i < n, O(n)
//or does it run certain number of times no matter what i < 100, O(1)

//only use worst case scenario, one that takes the longest

// algorithims are steo by step instructions to solve a problem
    //what takes less time and less machine work

//Time complexity
//Space Complexity

// split is O(n)

//recursion
// call function inside of itself and causes a loop
